        <h2>Delicious easy-to-make Sushi.</h2>
            <p>Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sushi rice</li>
                <li>Smoked salmon</li>
                <li>Wasabi</li>
                <li>Nori sheets</li>
                <li>Cucumber</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
                <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
                <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon and cucumber on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
                <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</li>
            </ol>
